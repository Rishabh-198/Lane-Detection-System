# Lane_Line_detection
In this project, we leverage Python and OpenCV—a robust open-source computer vision library—to detect lane lines in images. Our pipeline architecture encompasses key tools such as color selection, region of interest definition, grayscaling, smoothing, canny curve detection, and Hough Transform line detection.

**Color Selection:** Precision in lane line detection begins with meticulous color curation.

**Region of Interest Definition:** We focus on critical areas, honing in on the key regions housing vital lane line information.

**Grayscaling:** Transforming vibrant images into a monochrome canvas establishes the foundation for precise analysis.

**Smoothing:** A seamless transition between data points enhances overall visual clarity.

**Canny Curve Detection:** Edges come to life, providing a dynamic perspective on intricate lane line details.

**Hough Transform Line Detection:** The pinnacle of our project, transforming raw data into a visual representation of lane lines.

This project encapsulates a professional exploration of image processing, where Python and OpenCV synergize in a precise choreography of algorithms, delivering accurate lane line detection with each frame.
